'''
Given a string of words delimited by spaces, reverse the words in string.
For example, given "hello world here", return "here world hello"
Follow-up: given a mutable string representation, can you perform this operation in-place?
'''

line = input("Enter a line:\n")
print('You\'ve entered {0}'.format(line))
line = line.split()
line = line [::-1]
output = ' '.join(map(str,line))
print('Reversed Output as :{}'.format(output))
